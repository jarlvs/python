n=13
str(n)
repr(n)
`n`
do the same thing convert number into string.

import math 
floor(44)
sqrt(36)


raw_input()
get info from user and convert it to a string

array=list in python 
indexing start from 0;
last element also have -1 index apart from regular one.
second last has index -2 so and so forth..

strings are list
'prem'
p is 0,r is 1 like that.

slicing 
l=[1,2,3,4,2,4,2,5]
l[3:6]=[4,2,4]  start with index 3 
end with index 5 one less than 6.

l[3:] from index 3 till end [4,2,4,2,5]
l[:7] from start till index less than 7 
that is 6  [1,2,3,4,2,4,2]

editing sequence 
[7,5,4]+[5,6,7]=[7,5,4,5,6,7]
[4,3,5]+'prem' will give error

'prem'*4='premprempremprem'
[4,3]*3=[4,3,4,3,4,3]
4*3=12

name='prem'
'z' in name will give false as there is no 'z' 
in 'prem'.

family=['mom','dad','bro']
'sis' in family
false
lie that

len(parameter) will give length of parameter,
parameter can be list ,sequence

max(parameter) will give max element in list
same for min.
list('prem') will convert to ['p','r','e','m'] 

del number[3] will delect the number at index 3.

look at slicing once.
